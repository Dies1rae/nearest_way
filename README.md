# nearest_way
Lee algorithm implementation in finding nearest way problem.

In some game field we position two main points - start(@)-end(1). And also we can build a wall(!). Free points
on field represents as(.)
Lee algo is as BFS on graph, use waterfall princips to mark all free field with some weight, and then get all point with smalles weight

TODO
1) Optimize algo
2) Create class for reading cart from host
3) Add setopts and short opts
4) Optimize game class
5) Create new output game mod, maybe colors...
